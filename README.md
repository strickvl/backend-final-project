# Udacity Backend Path
## Final Project

This is code for the final project of the Udacity IPND (Backend Path)

The code offers functions to help keep track of a Swiss-style competition. 
Assuming an even number of players, the code sets up a database and two tables
that track the players and the matches they play.

In order to run this project, install/set up the `tournament.sql` file and then `tournament.py` offers all the functions. `tournament_test.py` offers a way to test the functions written in `tournament.py`.
